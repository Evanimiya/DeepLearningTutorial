## Instructions

In `main.py`, There are some basic examples including how to deal with torch.Tensor.

- examples_create_tensor()
- examples_manipulate_tensor()
- examples_operate_tensor()

##### Task 1
- Uncomment `examples_create_tensor()`, run it, and observe the results
- Refer to http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=tensor#creation-ops  and Create Torch.Tensor in various way by yourself.
- Check the GPU is available by torch.cuda.is_available() and if available, move tensors to GPU by .cuda() method.


##### Task 2
- Uncomment `examples_manipulate_tensor()`, run it, and observe the results
- Refer to http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=tensor#indexing-slicing-joining-mutating-ops and manipulate Torch.Tensor in various way by yourself.


##### Task 3
- Uncomment `examples_operate_tensor()`, run it, and observe the results
- Refer to http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=tensor#math-operations and test various Torch.Tensor operations in various way by yourself.
